 Excited to Share Our New Project Examination Management System! 



We’ve successfully developed a simulation   Examination Management System of ITI using Microsoft SQL Server to streamline exam processes, track student performance, and manage course-related activities. 



🔍Project Overview:



Our system is platform designed for educational institutions, enabling:
Students: To take exams, track progress, and view results.
Instructors: To create, manage, and assign exams effortlessly.
Managers: To oversee courses, tracks, and student intakes with ease.



Our database system incorporated key entities, including:

 - Exams

 - Instructors

 - Students

 - Courses

 - Branches

 - Intakes

 - Tracks
-Question 



🛠 Key System Features

Technical Highlights

💻 Relational Database Structure:

 Includes interconnected tables for Students, Instructors, Courses, Tracks, Exams, and Questions. Associative tables like Student_Exam_Questions and Exam_Questions efficiently manage

 many-to-many relationships.

🔧 SQL Server: Used stored procedures, views, and triggers and indexes for optimal performance.

📊 Custom Reports: Detailed, manually generated reports for tracking student performance and exam analytics.

🔄 Backups: daily backups for data security.



This project was a fantastic opportunity to combine technical skills with real-world challenges, resulting in a system that’s efficient, secure, and scalable.
